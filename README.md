This project implements 'instagram-like' app,
where you can load posts from remote server and upload your own posts with description

I use npm v.4.6.1 to manage packages (as v.5 cause errors with react-native), create-react-native-app as starter, redux as state container, redux-thunk for side-effect actions(fetch data for posts feed and upload data about created by user posts, Tabnavigation to navigate between app screens(3 one in app) and Expo ImagePicker Component to get access to device camera and image library. MyImagePicker is used to change user`s Icon or create posts (is handled by pickerStatus in redux store). 

You can try this app with Expo on iOS on Android by this link: https://exp.host/@alexplaksa17/avacadotestplaksa

If you have questions or ideas about this project feel free to contact me, I`ll add new features soon.
